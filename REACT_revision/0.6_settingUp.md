Setting Up a React App ourselves.

1. npm init 
= sets ups the package.json file (a config file for npm)

2. npm install parcel -d (-d => makes it a dev dependency)
= installs parcel

3. npx parcel source file (index.html)
=  
Parcel Initialization: Parcel initializes and sets up its build process.

Bundle Generation: Parcel analyzes the specified source file (index.html in the above example) and its dependencies, such as JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.

Dependency Resolution: Parcel resolves and bundles all dependencies, including transpiling modern JavaScript(ES6+), processing CSS with PostCSS, optimizing images, etc.

Output Generation: Parcel generates the bundled output in the specified output directory (usually dist/by default).

Server (Optional): If you specify an HTML file as the entry point, Parcel can also start a development server with hot module reloading, allowing you to view and test your application locally.

4. npm install react
= installs React

5. npm install react-dom
= installs react-dom

# make sure your Javascript file has type="module" otherwise it wont be able to recognize import commmands.

6. We can then set up required scripts in package.json.
