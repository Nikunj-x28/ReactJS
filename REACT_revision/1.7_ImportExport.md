## import and export
The import and export syntax is part of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). It was introduced as a standardized way
to manage modules in JavaScript. 

**Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning both the declaration and the definition are moved to the top of the scope.**
So we can export functions on top also before declaration.
### EXPORT Default
As there may be at most one default export per file, the exported entity may have no name.
``` 
// export a single value, without making a variable
export default ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar','Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];
```
When importing a default export, you can choose any name for the imported value.

### EXPORTING WITHOUT DEFAULT
```
  // mathUtils.js
  export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
  export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
  In this mathUtils.js module, we're exporting two named functions: add and subtract. Now let's import and use
  them in another file:

  // app.js
  import { add, subtract } from './mathUtils.js';

  console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
  console.log(subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2
```

In app.js, we import add and subtract using curly braces {} and specifying their names within the braces.
This syntax allows us to import only the named exports we need from the module mathUtils.js.

### IMPORT * SYNTAX
```
// Module.js
export const name = 'John';
export function greet() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}
const money = 7
export default money
// AnotherModule.js
import * as Module from './Module.js';
console.log(Module.name);
Module.greet();
console.log(Module.defaul) --> default export accessed
```
### IMPORT as
`import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';`

### EXPORT as
`export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};`

### RE EXPORT
‚ÄúRe-export‚Äù syntax `export ... from ...` allows to import things and immediately export them

Why would that be needed? Let‚Äôs see a practical use case.

Imagine, we‚Äôre writing a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù: a folder with a lot of modules, with some of the functionality exported outside. We‚Äôd like to expose the package functionality via a single entry point.
The ‚Äúmain file‚Äù, auth/index.js exports all the functionality that we‚Äôd like to provide in our package.
```
// import login/logout and immediately export them
import {login, logout} from './helpers.js';
export {login, logout};

// import default as User and export it
import User from './user.js';
export {User};
```

The syntax export ... from ... is just a shorter notation for such import-export:
```
// üìÅ auth/index.js
// re-export login/logout
export {login, logout} from './helpers.js';

// re-export the default export as User
export {default as User} from './user.js';
```

The notable difference of export ... from compared to import/export is that re-exported modules aren‚Äôt available in the current file. So inside the above example of auth/index.js we can‚Äôt use re-exported login/logout functions.
