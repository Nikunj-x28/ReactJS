# JSX (js syntax extension)
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.
JSX and React are two separate things. They’re often used together, but you can use them independently of each other. JSX is a syntax extension, while React is a JavaScript library. JSX looks a lot like HTML,
but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information. 

**Fundamentally, JSX just provides syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(component, props, ...children) function.**

## The Rules of JSX 
1. Return a single root element
= JSX looks like HTML, but under the hood it is transformed into plain JavaScript objects. You can’t return
  two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array. This explains why you also can’t return
  two JSX tags without wrapping them into another tag or a Fragment.

2. Close all the tags 
= JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like `<img>` must become `<img />`, and wrapping
  tags like `<li>`oranges must be written as `<li>`oranges`</li>`.

3. camelCase most of the things! 
= JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects. In your own
  components, you will often want to read those attributes into variables. But JavaScript has limitations
  on variable names. For example, their names can’t contain dashes or be reserved words like class.
  This is why, in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase. For example,class is a
  reserved word, in React you write className instead, named after the corresponding DOM property.

## Some more JSX
1. When you use JSX, you must start a tag with a capital letter to render your own custom component. 
In other words, `<Something />` is equivalent to createElement(Something), but `<something />` (lowercase)
is equivalent to createElement('something') (note it’s a string, so it will be treated as a built-in HTML tag).

2. You need to wrap jsx with ( ) if you write your JSX in multiple lines.

3. {} in JSX = can hold variables // to be precise any evaluated expression

## MORE about {} in JSX
Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside a markup.
In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.
1. When you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in single or double quotes.
2. Any JavaScript expression will work between curly braces, including function calls.

You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:

1. As text directly inside a JSX tag: `<h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>`
2. As attributes immediately following the '=' sign : onClick = {}

{{ and }} is not special syntax: it’s a JavaScript object tucked inside JSX curly braces.

Expressions inside JSX curly braces   
`src="{baseUrl}{person.imageId}{person.imageSize}.jpg"`  this wont work   
`src={baseUrl+person.imageId+person.imageSize+'.jpg'}`  this will work

## React.createElement
createElement lets you create a React element. It serves as an alternative to writing JSX.  
React element is a plain object describing a part of the UI .  
`const element = createElement(type, props, ...children)`
- The first argument is the type of the element, e.g., "div", "h1", "ul", "li", "a".
- The second argument is the props object, e.g., {} for no props or { href: "mailto:james@jamesknelson.com" } for an anchor tag's href attribute.
- The third and subsequent arguments are the children of the element.  
  
`<Component/> === Component()`

An unordered list created using React.createElement :
```
React.createElement( 
    "div", 
    {},   
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "Contacts"), 
    React.createElement( 
      "ul", 
      {}, 
      React.createElement( 
        "li", 
        {}, 
        React.createElement("h2", {}, "James Nelson"), 
        React.createElement( 
          "a", 
          { href: "mailto:james@jamesknelson.com" }, 
          "james@jamesknelson.com" 
        ) 
      ), 
      React.createElement( 
        "li", 
        {}, 
        React.createElement("h2", {}, "Joe Citizen"), 
        React.createElement( 
          "a", 
          { href: "mailto:joe@example.com" }, 
          "joe@example.com" 
        )  
      )
    ) 
);
```
Same Code with JSX
```
<div>
    <h1>Contacts</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>James Nelson</h2>
        <a href="mailto:james@jamesknelson.com">james@jamesknelson.com</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Joe Citizen</h2>
        <a href="mailto:joe@example.com">joe@example.com</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
</div>
```
