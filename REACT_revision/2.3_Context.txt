# REACT CONTEXT API
Context in React is used for sharing data between components in a component tree. It allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

In other words, context provides a way to make certain data accessible to many components in your application, regardless of how deeply nested they are in the component tree. 
The React Context API is a feature in React that allows you to pass context.

import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';

export default function Section({ level, children }) {
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    </section>
  );
}
This tells React: “if any component inside this <Section> asks for LevelContext, give them this level.” The component will use the value of the nearest <LevelContext.Provider> in the UI tree above it.
