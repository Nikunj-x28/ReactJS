# Props
React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. 
(something we can pass to a component/ arguments to a function)

Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag.The props you can pass to an <img> tag are predefined (ReactDOM conforms to the HTML standard). But you can pass any props to your own components.

Passing props to a component:
```
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```

Reading props inside the child component: 
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
