# Props
React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. 
(something we can pass to a component/ arguments to a function)

Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag.The props you can pass to an <img> tag are predefined (ReactDOM conforms to the HTML standard). But you can pass any props to your own components.

Custom Props: You can pass custom props to HTML elements in React, but consider using data-* attributes to ensure validity and compatibility.
HTML5 introduced data-* attributes as a way to store custom data on HTML elements. These attributes allow you to add custom data without violating the HTML specification. 

Passing props to a component:
```
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```
**Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how parent component passes props to a child component**

- Primitives (strings, numbers, booleans):  These are passed by value.
- Objects, Arrays, and Functions:           These are passed by reference.

And this brings us to one of the few strict rules that React gives us, which is that props are immutable. So they cannot be changed, they are read-only. And if at any point you feel like you need to mutate props actually what you need is state because state is for data that changes over time.


Reading props inside the child component: 
```
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
or 
function Avatar(props) {
  // props.person and props.size are available here
}

```
## React uses a so-called one-way data flow. 
- One-way data flow means that in React applications, data can only be passed from parent to child components, which happens by using props. So in other words, data can flow from parents to children but never the opposite way. 

- It makes applications way more predictable and way easier to understand for developers because it is just a lot easier to understand where the data is coming from if it only flows in one direction.
