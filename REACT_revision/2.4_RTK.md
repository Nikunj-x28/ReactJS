## Slices in RTK

In Redux Toolkit (RTK), a slice is a way to manage a specific part of your app's state along with the actions and reducers that work with that part of the state. The createSlice function in RTK makes it easier to set up and organize this logic.

Key Components of a Slice

- State: The initial state for that portion of the Redux store.
- Reducers: The functions that handle state transitions based on the actions.
- Actions: The action creators are automatically generated based on the reducers.

### Example of Creating a Slice

```
// counterSlice.js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
};

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter', // Name of the slice for devTools
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

// Export the actions to use them in components
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

// Export the reducer to include it in the store
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

Another Slice

```
// features/user/userSlice.js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'user',
  initialState: { name: '', email: '' },
  reducers: {
    setName: (state, action) => { state.name = action.payload },
    setEmail: (state, action) => { state.email = action.payload },
  },
});

export const { setName, setEmail } = userSlice.actions;
export default userSlice.reducer;
```

## Store in RTK

In Redux Toolkit (RTK), the store is a centralized place where the state of your entire application lives. It is the source of truth for the application's state, and it allows you to manage and update the state in a predictable way. The store holds the current state, allows you to dispatch actions, and notifies your application when the state changes.
When you add a slice's reducer to the Redux store, its initial state is automatically included in the store. This is part of how Redux Toolkit (RTK) simplifies the setup process for managing state.

```
// app/store.js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from '../features/counter/counterSlice';
import userReducer from '../features/user/userSlice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
    user: userReducer,
    // above names are given to the slices used later to access state of that slice.
    // to access user slice do state.user.name
    // to access counter slice do state.counter.value
  },
});

export default store;
```

Resulting State Structure with Multiple Slices:
When you add multiple slices' reducers to the store, the initial state of the store includes the initial states from all slices:

```

{
  counter: {
    value: 0  // Initial state from counter slice
  },
  user: {
    name: '',  // Initial state from user slice
    email: ''
  }
}
```

### Provide the Store to Your Application

Wrap your application in the Provider component from react-redux, passing it the store.

```
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './app/store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Actions and Reducers

Actions are plain JavaScript objects that contain a type field, which describes the type of action being performed, and additional payload data as needed.

Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
A reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.

How actions and reducers work :-

1. An action is tied to a reducer
2. Our UI dispatches an action object with its type and payload(optional)
3. According to the type the correseponding reducer is called and uses the payload to update the state
4. The store then notifes the components that have subscribed to the changed state

## React-Redux

React Redux is a library that provides seamless integration between Redux and React applications.
It gives us

- Provider component, which allows you to wrap your entire application with the Redux store, making the store accessible to all components.
- "Selectors" to efficiently extract data from the Redux store and pass it to connected components. Selectors memoize their results, ensuring that components only re-render when the relevant parts of the state change
- useDispatch that is a hook that returns a reference to the Redux store's dispatch function. This function is used to dispatch actions to the Redux store, triggering state changes.

### When you specify state => state.counter.value as the selector function in useSelector, React Redux will only re-render MyComponent when the value of state.counter.value changes. If other parts of the counter state change but not the value property specifically, MyComponent will not re-render.
