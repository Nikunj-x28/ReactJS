## USE_EFFECT
Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event.
Sending a message in the chat is an event because it is directly caused by the user clicking a specific button.
However, setting up a server connection is an Effect because it should happen no matter which interaction
caused the component to appear. Effects run at the end of a commit after the screen updates. This is
a good time to synchronize the React components with some external system (like network or a third-party library).\

**useEffect() hook accepts 2 arguments:**

`useEffect(callback,[dependencies])` 

Callback is a function that contains the side-effect logic. callback is executed right after the DOM update.
dependencies is an optional array of dependencies. useEffect() executes callback only if the dependencies have
changed between renderings.

Put your side-effect logic into the callback function, then use the dependencies argument to control when
you want the side-effect to run. That's the sole purpose of useEffect().
```
  import { useEffect } from 'react';

  function Greet({ name }) {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;   // Calculates output

  useEffect(() => {
      // Good!
      document.title = `Greetings to ${name}`; // Side-effect!
  }, [name]);

  return <div>{message}</div>;         // Calculates output
  }
```
For example, in the above code snippet you saw the useEffect() in action:
```
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Greetings to ${name}`;
}, [name]);
```
The document title update is the side-effect because it doesn't directly calculate the component
output. That's why the document title update is placed in a callback and supplied to useEffect().
Also, you don't want the document title update to run every time Greet component renders. You only
want it to happen when the name prop changes — that's the reason you supplied name as a dependency
to `useEffect(callback, [name])`

dependencies argument of useEffect(callback, dependencies) lets you control when the side-effect runs.
If dependencies are:
A. Not provided: the side-effect runs after every rendering.
B. An empty array []: the side-effect runs once after the initial rendering.

### Adding Cleanup
```
useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    // this is the unmounting phase
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();  // we return a Cleanup function
    };
  }, []);
```
The useEffect cleanup function is called in two circumstances:
- When the component unmounts. ( so we can attach general cleanup to useEffect cleanup func. )
- When the dependency array changes.

When you’re not sure whether some code should be in an Effect or in an event handler, ask yourself why this
code needs to run. Use Effects only for code that should run because the component was displayed to the user. 


### Why we cannot use async in useEffect callback ?

When React calls the useEffect callback, it expects either a cleanup function or nothing to be returned.
If you mark the useEffect callback as async, it implicitly returns a Promise, which React doesn't handle
in the same way as it handles cleanup functions or synchronous return values. This can lead to unexpected 
behavior or errors.

To work with asynchronous code inside a useEffect hook, you can use the async/await syntax within the callback function.
For example:
```
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const data = await response.json();
      // Process the data...
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle errors...
    }
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

### A case to ponder
1. Suppose i have the following react structure
    - Parentcomponent -> Childcomponent (useEffect(some API call), dependency=[])
2. Now the api call has started but while the call is in progress, state of parent changes 
3. It will trigger a re-render but as a result of that re-render will the api call start again ?

**ANS =** In React, if you have a ChildComponent with a useEffect hook that makes an API call and the dependency array for that useEffect is empty ([]), the API call will not be triggered again upon a re-render of the parent component. This is because the dependency array specifies that the useEffect should only run once when the component mounts.

4. Then if inside the useEffect API call if I had an old prop value then the api will continue to use that old value after re rendering also = **YES**

### What to have in dependency array ?
In most cases, you should only include state variables, props, or context values in the dependency array. These are the values that can cause the effect to behave differently and should trigger re-renders when they change.

If the dependencies don't have the potential to cause a re-render (for example, if they are constants or local variables that never change), then including them in the dependency array won't have any practical effect on the behavior of the useEffect hook.
