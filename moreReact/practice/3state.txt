STATE IN REACT

Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction.Components need to
“remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind
of component-specific memory is called state.

1. Local variables don’t persist between renders. When React renders this component a second time, it renders
   it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
2. Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component
   again with the new data.

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:
1. Retain the data between renders.
2. Trigger React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).


The position in the UI Tree matters to REACT .

App-> some condition -> true <BoxComponent with state count>
                      -> false<BoxComponent with state count>
      when we change the condition from true or false we may expect react to reset the count 
      as we will render a different component but React doesn’t know where we have placed the 
      conditions . All it "sees" is the tree we return. In both cases the App component has 
      BoxComponent as first child. To React thes two BoxComponents have the same address:
      the first child of the first child of the root.
      This is how React matches them up btw the previous and next renders , regardless of how
      we structure our logic.

      Consequently if we have different components at the same "address" it would trigger a re render
      of the whole subtree.

here toggling isPlayerA only changes the prop of Counter Component 
it still maintains the same state inside counter that is both of them share state.
{isPlayerA ? (
   <Counter person="Taylor" />
   ) : (
   <Counter person="Sarah" />
)}

Specifying a key tells React to use the key itself as part of the position, instead of their order within
 the parent. This is why, even though you render them in the same place in JSX, React sees them as two
 different counters, and so they will never share state.
{isPlayerA ? (
  <Counter key="Taylor" person="Taylor" />
) : (
  <Counter key="Sarah" person="Sarah" />
)}


State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn’t change objects and arrays
that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object and array, you need
to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then update the state to use that copy.
Usually, you will use the ... spread syntax to copy objects and arrays that you want to change.


import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
    artwork: {
      title: 'Blue Nana',
      city: 'Hamburg',
      image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
    }
  });

  function handleNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      name: e.target.value
    });
  }
}
