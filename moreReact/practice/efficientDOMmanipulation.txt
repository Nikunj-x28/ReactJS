Why React is fast ?
= Because of its diffing (Fibre) algo which does very efficient DOM manipulation.


Tell me with this example 
Upon a button click  react has to render a new div between two already existing divs
after updating the real DOM what steps the browser will take to reflect the new changes
and how different it would have been from a full page reload explain in depth

Sure, let's break down the steps involved when React renders a new <div> between two existing <div> elements
upon a button click, and how it differs from a full page reload:

React Update Process:

a. User Interaction: The user clicks a button triggering a state change or an event handler function in React.

b. State/Props Update: React updates the state or props associated with the component that needs to render the
   new <div>.

c. Virtual DOM Diffing: React performs a diffing process between the new virtual DOM (reflecting the updated
   state/props) and the previous virtual DOM snapshot to identify the minimal changes required.

d. Updating the Render Tree: React updates the render tree.In this case, it adds a new <div> between two existing
   <div> elements.

e. Layout and Painting: React updates the layout and paints the new <div> onto the screen, ensuring that it
   appears between the existing <div> elements as intended.

Browser Rendering Process (Step-by-Step):

a. DOM Tree Update: The browser receives the updated DOM from React and applies the changes to the real DOM.
   It inserts the new <div> between the two existing <div> elements.

b. Reconstruction of Render Tree: If necessary, the browser reconstructs the render tree by combining the
   updated DOM tree and CSSOM to create an updated representation of the visual hierarchy of elements on
   the page.

c. Layout Recalculation: The browser recalculates the layout to determine the size and position of elements
   affected by the changes. Since only a specific part of the page has changed, the layout recalculation
   is localized to the affected area.

d. Painting: Finally, the browser paints the updated elements onto the screen, rendering the new <div>
   between the existing <div> elements.


Comparison with Full Page Reload:

In the case of a full page reload:

a. Network Request: The browser sends a new request to the server to fetch the entire HTML document.

b. Server Processing: The server processes the request and generates a new HTML response.

c. Page Unload: The browser unloads the current page, discarding its current state and all its resources.

d. New Page Load: The browser receives the new HTML response from the server and parses it to construct a
                  new DOM tree from scratch.

e. CSS and JS Parsing: The browser also downloads and parses any linked CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.

f. Layout, Painting, and Rendering: Once the new DOM tree is constructed and CSS and JavaScript are parsed,
   the browser recalculates the layout, performs painting, and renders the entire page from scratch.

In summary, when React updates the DOM to render a new <div> between two existing <div> elements,
the browser's rendering process involves updating the DOM tree, reconstructing the render tree,
recalculating the layout, and painting the updated elements. This process is localized to the specific
area of the page that has changed, resulting in a faster and more efficient rendering 
compared to a full page reload, which involves reloading the entire page from scratch.
