*** REACT
Its a JavaScript library which helps in writing complex user interfaces.

***REACT and REACT-DOM
They are the main libraries for any react web development project.
REACT = It provides the fundamental building blocks for creating user interfaces with components,
state management, and rendering logic.It can be used to create UIs for various platforms, including web, 
mobile, and desktop.
REACT-DOM = ReactDOM is specifically designed to work with the browser environment.
It takes React components and renders them into the actual DOM (Document Object Model) of a web page,
allowing users to interact with them.

*** WHY NodeJS ?
React doesn't depend on node but the bundlers and packages used by most React developers do.
(Webpack, Babael etc.) So while React doesn't need node to run, most people install node for development.
You would be spending a lot of time building your own solution for bundling, transpiling, optimizing outside
of node. The web development packages built on node(npm) are too much of a time saver.

***BUNDLERS
Bundlers convert our React code to Browser readable format (among doing other things like optimization)
Webpack , vite are some bundlers.

*** BABEL
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write code using the latest ECMAScript (ES) standards
(or even future standards) and then transpile that code into an older version of JavaScript that can be
executed by current browsers or environments.

***NPM
Node Package Manager, commonly known as npm, is the default package manager for Node.js.The term "npm" is used
to refer to both the command-line tool (Node Package Manager) and the online package registry (npm Registry
/npm repository). npm is used to install, share, and manage dependencies in JavaScript projects.
While Node.js is a common runtime for many JavaScript packages, the npm registry is not exclusive to Node.js.
It is a central repository for a wide range of JavaScript packages that can be utilized in various environments
and platforms.

***NPM install
The npm install command installs packages specifically within your project folder,not globally on your system
npm install -g <package-name>
This installs the package globally on your system, making it available for use in any project.

***PACKAGE.JSON
npm utilizes a package.json file to manage project metadata and dependencies. This file includes information
about the project, its dependencies, and various configuration settings.

***NPM vs NPX
npm vs npx (both come with the NodeJs installation)
-> Npm is a tool that use to install packages.
-> Npx is a tool that use to execute packages.

***CRA
create-react-app is a utlitity software that automatically provides us a boilerplate to start our react project 
and installs all the packages related to the Build process.

***BUILD PROCESS
Process of making react code in browser friendly format.

***After running CRA command or Vite command
In our package.json file, we have some scripts set up for us: we can use these scripts to run our
development server , build - to create a version of your project that's optimized for deployment to a
production environment , and other scripts.
