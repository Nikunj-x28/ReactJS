Bundlers = bundle our code in a single file.

Dependencies = Dev Dependencies and Normal Dependencies
               npm install -D -> tell npm it is a dev dependency.

npm init = The npm init command is used to initialize a new Node.js/React project and creates
           a package.json file, which is a metadata file for the project. 

package.json= configuration file for npm it keeps track of which version of the dependency
              we are using. 

package-lock.json= keeps track of exact version of dependency and their transitive dependencies.
                   gets updated when we update dependencies.
                   It ensures consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

^ vs ~ = The caret (^) allows for more flexibility in updating dependencies by permitting minor version updates,
         while the tilde (~) restricts updates to only the latest patch versions within a fixed minor version.
         Neither the caret (^) nor the tilde (~) operators will update to a new major version of a dependency. 

node_modules = actual data 
               node_modules has all the transitive dependencies
               our dependency-> parcel -> its dependency -> ....

npx = executing a package

Not a good way to bring React to our project
versions may change of React in future also fetching a network resource
could be expensive.

browserlist = Developers often use tools like Babel or Autoprefixer, which leverage the "browserlist"
               configuration to determine which transformations and optimizations are necessary for the
               target browsers.
               other browsers may also work that are not in the browserlist.
               but all the browsers will definitely work that are in the browserlist.

npm scripts = just a way to save time and get away from big commands.
              syntax -> npm run script
              npm run start -> npm start (only works for start)
              This shorthand is provided by npm for convenience and is specifically designed for start.

Babel = Babel is a widely-used JavaScript compiler that converts modern ES6+ code into backward-compatible
        JavaScript, enabling it to run in older browsers and environments. It allows developers to leverage
        the latest language features without worrying about compatibility issues. Babel can also transform 
        JSX syntax used in React into plain JavaScript, making it an essential tool for modern web development,
        ensuring code cleanliness and broad compatibility.

Our React code is readable because of JSX.
Our React code is fast because of React , Parcel(bundlers) and other tools.

You need to wrap jsx with ( ) if you write your JSX in multiple lines.
