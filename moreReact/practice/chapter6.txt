Monolith Architecture =>
whole project is cohesivley linked.


Microservices Architecture =>
seperation of concern
services talk to each other
each service can be developed indepedently.

Approaches
1. as soon as page loads call the API and then show data in UI
2. as soon as page loads render the ui then make API call then re render with new data

approach 2 is better User experience

How can const state variables be changed 
=> as react rerenders the component new state varibale is created and
   it is initialized with the updated value .The previous const state
   varible doesnt change its value.

DIST folder in Parcel Project
=> In a Parcel project, the dist (short for "distribution") folder typically contains the output of the build
  process. When you run the build command in a Parcel project, it compiles and bundles your source code
 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and generates the final optimized assets, which are then placed in the dist
  folder.

Optional Chaining
=> Optional chaining is a feature introduced in JavaScript ES2020 (ECMAScript 2020) that allows you to access
   properties or methods of an object without worrying about whether the object or its properties exist.
   It provides a concise way to handle potentially null or undefined values in a chain of property accesses.

Shimmer UI
=>  It's often used to indicate that content is loading or to draw attention to specific elements on a webpage
    or application. Shimmer effects are commonly used in loading placeholders for images, text, or other UI
    components.

UseEffect 
=> 1. No dependency = Called every time after rendering
   2. [] = Empty dependency array. Called only on initial render (just once).
   3. [some dependency] = Called on initial render. Called again when dependency changes

UseState
=> 1. Always use this inside a component at the top level.
