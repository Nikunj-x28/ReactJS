Managing Data Layer

1. Higher Order component
=  It is a function that takes a component enhances it and returns the component.

2. Lifting State Up

3. Controlled component
=  Parent has state and that state has some control over this component

4. Props Drilling
=  Passing data to descendents more efficiently.

5. React Context
=  Global place where our data is kept. We can get this data anywhere in our app. 

6. Redux vs Context
=  Context works for small and mid scale. But in large scale apps redux is more
   suitable.

useContext 
<Usercontext.consumer></Usercontext.consumer>

<UserContext.Provider value={}>
    //wrap around the portion where we want the context to take a dynamic value
</UserContext.Provider>


why ? useContext(contextname)
