CDN
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a network of distributed servers strategically located across
various geographical locations. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver web content to users more
efficiently and reliably.
When a user requests content from a website, such as images, videos, CSS files, or JavaScript files, the CDN
serves that content from the nearest server location to the user's geographical location. This reduces
latency and accelerates the delivery of content, leading to faster loading times and a better user experience.

CROSSORIGIN
The "crossorigin" attribute is an HTML attribute used primarily with the <script> and <link> elements to
specify how the browser should handle loading resources.
The "crossorigin" attribute can have the following values:
"anonymous": This is the default value. It indicates that the resource should be fetched without sending any 
credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication). It is suitable for publicly available resources.

"use-credentials": This value indicates that the browser should include credentials (such as cookies or HTTP
authentication) when fetching the resource. It is suitable for resources that require authentication.

LIBRARY vs FRAMEWORK
FRAMEWORK - strict (framework is a set of rules that provides a foundation for building applications.)
LIBRARY - little lenient (library is a collection of reusable code modules or functions that can be imported )
React can work on any portion of the webpage (not necessarily we need to apply it on the whole webpage).
React is a JS library.
